I have used a provided theme fror bootswatch called pulse (https://bootswatch.com/pulse/). 
I have also used many different class types:
- there is added responsiveness of the navbar. It collapse into a drop down list if the 
  window size of browser is minimized. It shows the complete navbar if the window size 
  is maximized. 
- the navi items shows when a webpage is active by being the color white. 
- the nav bar is sticky so it is displayed under the banner but will move to the top of 
  the page if you scroll beyond the initial area.
- the colors are better due to the theme from bootswatch.
- the corners of the body container is rounded
- the spacing for the label and input on the contact form is more aligned and in the same row.
