     <h2> About Me </h2>
     <p> My name is Tammy Liu. I am a detail-oriented college student, currently attending University of Massachusetts Lowell for both my Computer Science and Mathematics Degree. Additionally, I have previously obtained a nursing degree from Bunker Hill Community College. My experience in nursing school and clinicals has helped me develop skills in medical terms and treatments that can assist me in my career path of becoming a healthcare data analyst to better meet the needs of our clients and partners. I have been taught ADPIE (Assessment, Diagnosis, Planning, Implementation, and Evaluation), a necessary accessing tool used to obtain information on a patient to provide individualized care. I believe that my academic skills and accomplishments compliment my social skills and dedication to hard work in such a way that would make me an excellent and productive worker for this company.
     </p>
     <p> Resourceful, persevering, and hardworking are just a few of the words that I would use to describe myself. Despite being in a male dominated field, my assertiveness has allowed me to bring my ideas forward to be heard and utilized in many situations. I live by the quote, “Success is no accident. It is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all, love of what you are doing or learning to do.” Whenever I am faced with some daunting task, I consider this quote and the ideas it speaks about; this quote guides my decision making and has brought me great success in many scenarios. A good example of hard work and perseverance would come from the time I decided to change my career path from Nursing to Computer Science. After spending years attending college for a Nursing degree, I decided that nursing was not the right career for me. However, this did not hold me back or stop me. I came back to college for a degree in Computer Science. This was a huge change. I went from taking care of people to taking care of code. It was a tough journey as learning how to code is like learning a new language; but by working hard at it, I was about to pass all my courses and maintain a GPA of 3.75.
     </p>
     <p> As a single mother from a huge immigrant family, being able to afford an education is nearly impossible. This is where my resourcefulness kicked in. I started to research schools that provided me the adequate skills needed for a job while still being affordable. Once I had decided on the university I intended to attend, I looked for scholarships both private and public. Thankfully, I was chosen for multiple scholarships and was able to attend UMass Lowell with the help of these sponsors. Through perseverance, I finished my spring 2020 semester with straight A’s for all six courses; this happened while I was balancing the new role as an educator to my son, the stress of unemployment due to the pandemic known as COVID-19, and the adaptation to changes affecting my everyday life.
     </p>
     <p> From a social standpoint, I have been told by my close friends and family that I have many skills such as conflict resolution and mediation, assertiveness, and personability which is due to my friendly demeanor. Because of my friendly demeanor, people find me approachable, agreeable, and personable. My socializing skills are best demonstrated by my association with professors and academic administrators. While some people may feel timid about approaching a professor in a higher social position, I am able to utilize my social skills to engage in friendly conversation with many of my past professors. This has given me great opportunities for jobs and recommendations. Even among my student peers, I am able to continuously provide advice and support because of my lived experiences and knowledge about the world.
     </p>
     <p> Something very important to me is my family and friends. I come from a huge family, all of whom I love very much but are also a pain in my butt. I am the oldest of four children followed by two younger sisters and a younger brother. Most importantly, I am a mother to a eleven-year-old little boy named Antonio. We call him AJ and I cannot wait till he goes off to college. My friends have been with me through a lot to the point where some of them have become family. Many of them are wonderful people who have supported me and have helped me realize my true value as a person.
     </p>
     <p> In my spare time, if my busy schedule allows for it, I like playing video games and had a very brief streaming career on twitch. I also like hanging out with friends; attending concerts, reviewing hole in the wall restaurants, having spontaneous adventures, and exploring new anime, music, tv shows, and fanfics. I am always looking to try something new and expand my knowledge and experiences. Given the chance and time, I would like to travel and experience other cultures. You can also find me regularly in karaoke bars singing my favorite songs and jamming to others.
     </p>
     <p> As someone who is always doing something, I always have short term and long-term goals set for myself. Since my academic pursuit over the last few years has been to discover and build a satisfying and successful career, I hoped to be able to expand my technical skill set and intellectual understanding of different programs and programming languages. This will provide me personal fulfilment in that it will help provide for my family and me. A long-term goal would be to advance my career —I hope one day to advance further into a managerial position within a good company. This would increase my job security and long-term marketability by solidifying my confidence in being a data analyst. I truly believe that I am fully capable of achieving these goals and hope to do so with flying colors.
     </p>
     <p> Although I understand that my skills as an individual may very well qualify me for this position, I also know that I cannot generate or achieve my professional goals if I were completely alone. I believe in teamwork and would need, what I call, the three C’s from those around me: that is, cooperation, counseling, and commitment. With your support I believe we can, as a team, achieve great success that will further propel all our careers. I am looking forward to working with all of you.
